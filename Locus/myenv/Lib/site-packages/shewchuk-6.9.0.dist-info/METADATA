Summary
-------

`shewchuk` is a collection of computational geometry utilities
for robust processing of geometries with floating point coordinates.

Named after and based on [the work](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html)
of [Jonathan Richard Shewchuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Shewchuk).

---

In what follows `python` is an alias for `python3.8` or `pypy3.8`
or any later version (`python3.9`, `pypy3.9` and so on).

Installation
------------

Install the latest `pip` & `setuptools` packages versions
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

### User

Download and install the latest stable version from `PyPI` repository
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade shewchuk
```

### Developer

Download the latest version from `GitHub` repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lycantropos/shewchuk.git
cd shewchuk
```

Install
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

Usage
-----
```python
>>> from shewchuk import incircle_test
>>> incircle_test(3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2) == -1
True
>>> incircle_test(2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2) == 0
True
>>> incircle_test(1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2) == 1
True
>>> from shewchuk import kind
>>> kind(1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0) == -1
True
>>> kind(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0) == 0
True
>>> kind(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0) == 1
True
>>> from shewchuk import orientation
>>> orientation(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0) == -1
True
>>> orientation(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0) == 0
True
>>> orientation(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1) == 1
True

```

Development
-----------

### Bumping version

#### Preparation

Install
[bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version#installation).

#### Pre-release

Choose which version number category to bump following [semver
specification](http://semver.org/).

Test bumping version
```bash
bump2version --dry-run --verbose $CATEGORY
```

where `$CATEGORY` is the target version number category name, possible
values are `patch`/`minor`/`major`.

Bump version
```bash
bump2version --verbose $CATEGORY
```

This will set version to `major.minor.patch-alpha`.

#### Release

Test bumping version
```bash
bump2version --dry-run --verbose release
```

Bump version
```bash
bump2version --verbose release
```

This will set version to `major.minor.patch`.

### Running tests

Install with dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -e .[tests]
```

Plain
```bash
pytest
```

Inside `Docker` container:
- with `CPython`
  ```bash
  docker-compose --file docker-compose.cpython.yml up
  ```
- with `PyPy`
  ```bash
  docker-compose --file docker-compose.pypy.yml up
  ```

`Bash` script:
- with `CPython`
  ```bash
  ./run-tests.sh
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ./run-tests.sh cpython
  ```

- with `PyPy`
  ```bash
  ./run-tests.sh pypy
  ```

`PowerShell` script:
- with `CPython`
  ```powershell
  .\run-tests.ps1
  ```
  or
  ```powershell
  .\run-tests.ps1 cpython
  ```
- with `PyPy`
  ```powershell
  .\run-tests.ps1 pypy
  ```
